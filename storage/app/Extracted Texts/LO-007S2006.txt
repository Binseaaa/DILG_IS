MAYOR VICENTE P. EUSEBIO

Pasig City

Dear Mayor Eusebio:

This refers to your request for this Department's legal opinion involving the succession of barangay elective officials.

Per your letter, the following facts are presented, to wit:

⚫ The Punong Barangay of Barangay Bambang, that City was elected as City Councilor, thus, a permanent vacancy in the said position occurred;

On account thereof, the highest ranking Sangguniang Barangay Member, pursuant to Section 44 (b) of the Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160), became the Punong Barangay;

⚫ However, this successor Punong Barangay was placed under preventive suspension by the Ombudsman.

You are now in a quandary as to who shall be the "legal successor" to the Office of the Punong Barangay, as it is your view that Section 44 (b) of RA 7160 applies only once, which means that when the highest ranking sangguniang barangay member has assumed the position of Punong Barangay, the rule on automatic succession is no longer applicable and also, the rule on automatic succession only applies to the position of a duly elected Punong Barangay and not to the official who succeeded. Hence, your query.

In reply thereto, please be informed that the rule of permanent succession under Section 44 (b) of RA 7160 is not singly applied. Everytime the post of Punong Barangay becomes permanently vacant, the highest sangguniang barangay member shall become the Punong Barangay by operation of law. The only time succession stops is when there is nobody to succeed anymore from the regular members of the sangguniang barangay. The SK Chairman, as ex-officio member of the
