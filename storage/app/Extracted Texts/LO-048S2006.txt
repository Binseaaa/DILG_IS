ATTY. JOSEPH J.R. CASTILLO
City Legal Officer
City Hall, Pasay City

Dear Atty. Castillo:

This refers to your query on the following matters, to wit:

1. "Can an incumbent Barangay Chairman act as Officer-in-Charge (OIC) in a Department of a City Government (LGU) without losing his position as Barangay Chairman?

2. Assuming the answer to above question is positive. Can the said Barangay Chairman accept his honoraria as a Barangay Chairman and at the same time receive his pay and salary as a head department?"

In reply to your first query, may we invite your attention to Section 7 (V), Article IX of the 1987 Constitution, which provides, thus:

"SEC. 7. No elective official shall be eligible for appointment or designation in any capacity to any public office or position during his tenure."

This constitutional proscription is further reiterated in Section 94 (a) of the Local Government Code, which expressly states, in part, that:

"No elective or appointive local official shall be eligible for appointment or designation in any capacity to any public office or position during his tenure."

Clearly from the foregoing, a Punong Barangay, being an elective official, is not eligible for appointment or designation in any capacity to any public office or position in the city government.

In reply to your second query, may we point out that the issue on double compensation becomes irrelevant as in the first place, the Punong Barangay is not eligible for appointment.

We hope we have enlightened you on the matter.

Very truly yours,

WENCELITO T. ANDANAR
Undersecretary
