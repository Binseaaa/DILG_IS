MS. LUZ A. CORPUZ
Sto. Tomas, La Union

Dear Ms. Corpuz:

This refers to your letter asking this Department to render a decision on the
matter of the election of Epidio Barroga as member of the Sangguniang Barangay of
Poblacion, Sto. Tomas, La Union.

As you represented, before the 2007 barangay elections, you informed the
Comelec local offices that Mr. Barroga is not qualified to run for an elective post
because he has been convicted of the crime of Grave Threats. Notwithstanding, Mr.
Barroga ran for, won and assumed office as member of the sangguniang barangay of
Poblacion, Sto. Tomas, La Union. He is now trying to collect his honorarium but the
treasurer and municipal accountant refused. You now ask us to render a decision on
the matter to settle the same once and for all.

In response thereto, please be informed that we do not have the power and
authority to render decision as to the qualification of Mr. Barroga or the legality of his
assumption to office. Thus, we regret to inform you that we cannot act accordingly on
your request.

Anent the claims for honorarium, we are of the view that Mr. Barroga is entitled
thereto provided he attends the sessions of the Sangguniang barangay. He has not
been disqualified to hold the office of a member of the sangguniang barangay so that he
is deemed to have held the same legally. To withhold him his honorarium may amount
to a liability insofar as those responsible therefor is concerned.

Hope we have enlightened you on the matter.

Very truly yours,

AUSTERE A. PANADERO
Undersecretary
