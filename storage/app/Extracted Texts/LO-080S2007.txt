Dear Ms. Brual:

This pertains to your letter dated 23 July 2007. As a backgrounder, the following facts are pertinent:

1. "The development permit for the subdivision project was granted in December 1985 by the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), then Housing Subdivision Regulatory Commission (HSRC), to the previous owner, General Romeo Gatan. Development is under PD 957.

2. The area covered by the project is 50 hectares (500,000 square meters), already subdivided into 1,541 lots with individual titles.

3. An application for Exemption Clearance was filed by Rightland Corporation, the owner of the property previous to Fog Horn, with the Municipal Agrarian Reform Office (MARO) in Angeles City which was supported by a Certification from the MARO that the property was already classified into residential since September 5, 1984 and an Ocular Inspection Report also by the MARO dated February 5, 2003.

4. In December 2006, Fog Horn, Inc., the current owner/developer, was granted a Certificate of Registration and License to Sell by the HLURB for the said property. The License to Sell specified that Fog Horn is exempted from Sec. 18 of RA 7279, which is the implementation of the 20% Socialized Housing.

5. A Mayor's Business Permit was issued to Fog Horn on February 6, 2007 and valid until December 31, 2007.

6. Fog Horn also obtained an Environmental Compliance Certificate from DENR-EMB Region 3.

7. A letter-query on the validity of the development permit of Savannah Green Plains was sent by the Office of Engr. David David, City Planning Officer of Angeles City, to HLURB. The reply of HLURB dated April 2, 2007 confirmed the validity and efficacy of the said permit albeit issued in 1985 for reasons cited. The following improvements introduced by the previous developer are still evident curbs and gutters in some portions of the property, perimeter fence for the 50-hectare property and five (5) model houses of about 80 square meters each.

8. Further, Sanggunian Panlungsod Resolution No. 5201, S-2007 (a Resolution Requesting the City Engineer's Office to Stop the On-going Development by Rightland Corporation in Purok 1 and 2, Barangay Cuayan, Angeles City) was issued on July 16, 2007 and Resolution No. 5306, S-2008 (a Resolution Requesting the City Mayor Carmelo F. Lazatin to issue a Cease and Desist Order on the Continuous Development of Savannah Green Plains, Barangay Cuayan, Angeles City for Failure to Comply with the Provisions of RA 7279) was issued in June 2007. Both resolutions have not been implemented as of date.

9. Fog Horn has been continuously receiving invitations from the Sanggunian to attend sessions and Committee hearings regarding our project."

The issues raised by the Sanggunian members in relation to the aforementioned are as follows:

1. "The development permit (DP) issued by the HLURB is not valid anymore since it was issued 20 years ago and the development is being implemented only in 2007, hence a new DP should be secured, this time, from the Sanggunian.

2. If at all valid, the DP is valid only for the development/improvements introduced in January of 1988 and the remaining undeveloped area must be subjected to a new DP to be granted by the Sanggunian.

3. The devolution of the functions of the HLURB as far as the issuance of the DP is concerned divest HLURB of its jurisdiction over the DP of Savannah Green Plains.

4. The City Planning Officer of Angeles City should be the one to inspect the property and not HLURB.

5. A case in court should be filed by the Sanggunian against HLURB with FHI as co-defendant in view of the development being undertaken at Savannah Green Plains pursuant to the DP issued by the HLURB, which the members of the Sanggunian insist is not valid anymore at present times.
