Dear Sir:

This has reference to your 08 February 2007 letter requesting for this
Departmentâ€™s legal opinion on your hereunder quoted queries, to wit:

1. "Can a barangay captain duly elected can file a
certificate of candidacy as Member of the
Sangguniang Bayan without resigning or considered
resigned from his position as Barangay Captain?
Can he/she return to his post when he or she is
defeated in said election?

2. Can a barangay captain duly elected or selected by
the Association of Barangay Captains and become as
Ex-Officio Member of the Sangguniang Bayan be
considered resigned when he filed his certificate of
candidacy as Member of the Sangguniang Bayan?
Can he/she return to his/her old post if she is
defeated in the election?"

In reply thereto, please find attached herewith, this Departmentâ€™s
Advisory on the effects of filing of certificate of candidacy which was
issued on 12 January 2007.

Please be informed further that since an ABC President, who is
necessarily an Punong Barangay, is not considered resigned as Punong
Barangay upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy for another
position, he can retain such Punong Barangay position in case he lost in
his election bid. He shall likewise remain as Liga President unless sooner
removed as Liga President pursuant to the Liga ng mga Barangay
Constitution and By Laws.

We hope we have guided you accordingly.

Very truly yours,

G. J. EMETERIO S. MORENO, JR.
Director III
