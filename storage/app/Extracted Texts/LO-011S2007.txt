MR. DANILO C. SAN JUAN
Punong Barangay
Liga Ng Mga Barangay President
Cainta, Rizal

Dear Punong Barangay San Juan:

This has reference to your earlier verbal query asking our opinion on the
legality of Resolution No. 02, s. 2006 entitled "Resolved to Order the
Holding of Special Election for All Positions" issued by the National
Executive Board (NEB) of the Liga ng Mga Barangay mandating the conduct of a
special election to fill all positions from the President down to the last director of
the Municipal Liga ng mga Barangay of Cainta, Rizal.

After a further examination of the documents forwarded to this
Department and guided by the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in the case
of Bito-onon vs. Fernandez (G.R. No. 139813, 31 January 2001) where it was
enunciated that the DILG only exercises supervision, not control, over the Liga ng
mga Barangay, we regret to inform you that we refrain to answer your query.

However, if you think that the Resolution subject of your query suffers
from legal infirmity, it would be advisable for you to seek the aid of our courts by
filing therein the appropriate pleading since this Department is bereft of any
authority to declare invalid the subject Resolution passed by the National
Executive Board of the National Liga ng mga Barangay.

We hope that we have addressed your concern accordingly.

Very truly yours,

WENCELITO T. ANDANAR
Undersecretary
