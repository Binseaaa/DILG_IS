DILG OPINION No. 65 s.2021

SECRETARY WENDEL E. AVISADO
Department of Budget and Management Boncodin Hall, General Solano St., San Miguel Manila

THRU:	DIRECTOR GERALD R. JANDA
Organization, Position Classification and Compensation Bureau

Dear Secretary Avisado:

This has reference to the letter dated 12 March 2021 from the Sangguniang Bayan of Mambusao, Capiz, requesting for clarification regarding the creation of Municipal Government Assistant Department Head position created under Municipal Ordinance No. 03 series of 2021 in the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office of Mambusao, Capiz with a parenthetical position title "Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Officer".

As represented in the subject letter, the aforesaid position was created in line with Items 5.6 and 6.2 of NDRRMC-DILG-DBM-CSC JMC No. 2014-1 to elevate the position of the incumbent Local DRRM Officer with a Salary Grade 18 which was created pursuant to Item 5.3 of JMC No. 2014-1.

The Sangguniang Bayan (SB) of Mambusao, Capiz created Municipal Government Assistant Department Head (MGADH) I (SG 22) position instead of MGADH II (SG 23) based on the actual level of organization (Standard Leveling of Positions) adopted by it pursuant to Item 6.2 of the aforementioned JMC and Republic Act (RA) No. 6758, otherwise known as the "Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, which further implemented by Chapter 9 of the Department of Budget and Management Manual on Position Classification and Compensation.

On 9 March 2021, the HRMO-Designate went to the Civil Service Commission (CSC) Capiz Field Office (FO) for the publication of the aforesaid position. However, the request for publication was not granted. Ostensibly, the CSC Capiz FO is of the position that the aforecited Municipal Ordinance which created MGADH II (SG 23) position contradicts the NDRRMC-DILG-DBM-CSC JMC No. 2014-1, specifically Item No. 5.6 thereof, which mentioned that MGADH II (SG 23) should be created for 1st to 3rd class municipalities.

Herein concerned SB, on the other hand, is of the belief that it can create the MGADH II (SG 23) position if they are implementing a different or higher Level of Organization (Standard Leveling of Positions). As mentioned in the subject letter, herein concerned SB opted to create MGADH I (SG 22) position instead of MGADH II (SG 23) "to follow the Level of Organization/Standard Leveling of Positions prescribed for and currently implemented within the LGU for the sake of uniformity, fairness, and equality to everyone especially to other Municipal Government Assistant Heads I (SG 22) who are already long in the service."

Under such premise, arose the subject request for clarification on the following issues, viz:

1. Is the Sangguniang Bayan correct in creating the MGADH I (SG 22) position instead of MGADH II (SG 23) based on the Level of Organization/Standard Leveling of Positions prescribed for a 3rd Class Municipality currently adopted by the LGU? And

2. Can the Sangguniang Bayan create additional positions, divisions, or sections in the concerned departments of the LGU without funding support? If in case it can, could these created positions/divisions/sections be included in the Organization Structure, Staffing Pattern, and Plantilla of Personnel of the LGU?

We respectfully note that the queries proffered herein appear to be beyond this Department's technical competence. Hence, we deem it apt to refer the matter to your good Office for appropriate action.

Further, Item 8.1 of the aforecited JMC provides that the "DBM shall provide technical assistance in the establishment of LDRRMO, including but not

limited	to	its	organization,	position	classification,	and	compensation schemes."

We would appreciate if your good Office would furnish us copy/ies of the action/s taken thereon.

Thank you. Very truly yours,
BY AUTHORITY OF THE SECRETARY:


MARLO L. IRINGAN, CESO III
