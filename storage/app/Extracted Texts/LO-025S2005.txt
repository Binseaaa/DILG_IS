OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY

DILG OPINION NO. 25, S. 2005
09 May 2005

MR. BONIFACIO M. QUIROG, JR.
Provincial Secretary
Provincial Capitol Building
Tagbilaran City

Dear Mr. Quirog:

This refers to your request for this Department's opinion on the
authority of the Provincial Governor to invest funds in the form of treasury
bills vis-Ã -vis the requisite authorization from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.

As disclosed, on 15 March 1996, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of
Bohol issued Resolution No. 114, s. 1996, authorizing former Governor
Rene L. Relampagos to deposit unused/idle funds of the province under
time deposit accounts and government securities.

Apparently, the said Resolution above became the basis for the
incumbent Governor to recently invest provincial funds by purchasing
treasury bills.

You have now posited the following queries, to wit:

1. "Can the incumbent Governor invest funds in the
form of treasury bills without the authority of the
present Sangguniang Panlalawigan?

2. Can Resolution Number 114, series of 1996,
authorizing the previous Governor Rene L.
Relampagos, "to deposit unused/idle funds of the
province under time deposits (sic) accounts and
government securities" be used as a basis for the
present administration to invest in treasury bills?"

Before addressing your concerns, may we apprise you of certain
principles regarding the fiscal administration of local government units.

Please be informed that per Section 15 of the Local Government
Code, a local government unit (LGU) has two (2) functions, i.e.,
governmental and corporate. The former refers to the authority of the LGU
to exercise its powers as expressly granted by the law and those necessarily
implied therefrom for the promotion of the general welfare of its inhabitants.

On the other hand, the corporate powers of the LGU pertain to the latter's
proprietary functions to address its economic enterprises.

Just like any other private corporation engaged in business, LGUs
enjoy the formerâ€™s attributes, such that under Section 22 of the Local
Government Code, LGUs are given the following corporate powers: (1) to
have continuous succession in its corporate name; (2) to sue and be
sued; (3) to have and use a corporate seal; (4) to acquire real or
personal property; (5) to enter into contracts; and (6) to exercise
such other powers as granted to corporations, subject to
limitations provided in the Code and other laws.

Ergo, if the issue would only be limited to whether or not the Local
Chief Executive, as the official representative of the LGU, is allowed to
invest in treasury bills, then such act of investment, which falls within the
ambit of the corporate powers of the LGU, finds legal basis. However, there
are other things that ought to be considered.

May it be noted that while LGUs, through its Chief Executives, are
essentially empowered to enter into contracts, such execution needs to satisfy
certain requirements for the validity of the contract itself, to wit:

1. The LGU has the express, implied or inherent power
to enter into such a particular contract;

2. The contract is entered into by the proper
department, board, committee, officer or agent.
Unless otherwise provided by the Code, no contract
may be entered into by the Local Chief Executive on
behalf of the LGU without prior authorization by the
sangguniang concerned;

3. The contract must comply with certain substantive
requirements, i.e., when expenditure of public funds
is to be made, there must be an actual appropriation
and a certificate of availability of funds; and

4. The contract must comply with the formal
requirements of written contracts, e.g. the statute of
frauds (Nachura, Outline Review in Political Law,
2002 Ed., p. 493).

It is not amiss to point out that investment in treasury bills involves
the execution of a contract between the Investor and the Bank issuing such
treasury notes. Such being the case, the Local Chief Executive, who intends
to invest the local government funds in such treasury bills, needs to secure
prior authorization from his/her sanggunian pursuant to the clear and
categorical language of Section 22 (c) of RA 7160. Otherwise stated,
without prior authorization from the sanggunian concerned, the Local Chief
Executive can not enter into such contract.
