Dear Ms. Corbit:
This has reference to your letter dated 22 December 2020 seeking legal opinion whether a Punong Barangay (PB) should have secured first a written permission from this Department before serving as an attorney-in-fact of a landholder.
Per your letter, by virtue of a Special Power of Attorney, a PB was tasked to transact with a construction company in behalf of the principal/landholder.
At the outset, it may be well to note that there was no representation as to what profession or occupation that the Punong Barangay was practicing or engaging into, respectively, when he was given a Special Power of Attorney to transact with a construction company in behalf of the principal/landholder.
Assuming that when the PB was given a Special Power of Attorney to transact with a construction company in behalf of the principal/landholder he is practicing a profession or engaging an occupation, Section 90 of the Local Government Code of 1991 provides and we qoute:
"SEC 90. PRACTICE OF PROFESSION. - (a) All governors, city and municipal mayors are prohibited from practicing their profession or engaging in any occupation other than the exercise of their functions as local chief executives."
In view of the above-cited provision it is clear that the prohibition applies only to the governors, city and municipal mayors, no such interdiction is made on the PB and members of the sangguniang barangay. Since they are excluded from the prohibition, the presumption is that they are allowed to practice their profession or engage in any other occupation.
