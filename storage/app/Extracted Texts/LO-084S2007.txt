OFFICE OF THE UNDERSECRETARY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

MR. VICTOR T. ESTRENGO
Punong Barangay
Barangay Sanj
City of Toledo, Cebu

Dear PR Garota:

This has reference to your earlier letter where you forwarded to us several documents relative to the civil case (boundary dispute) between your barangay and Barangay Daan Lungsod also of the same City, now pending resolution before Branch 7 of the Regional Trial Court, that City, with a further request therein for an immediate action on the matter.

In this regard, please be advised that we are constrained to refrain from taking action on the matter in view of the basic Constitutional principle of separation of branch and powers.

As you presented, the instant controversy is already the subject of a civil case filed and is now pending before Branch 7 of the RTC of the City of Toledo, Cebu. Thus, the controversy is already within the domain of the judicial branch of the government. Such being the case, this Department, which is under the executive branch, is not at good liberty to act on the matter as we might be accused of violating the sub-judice rule, which is considered as a malicious act against the court.

We hope that we have addressed your concern accordingly.

Very truly yours,

ASTRIER A. PANALIGAN
Undersecretary
