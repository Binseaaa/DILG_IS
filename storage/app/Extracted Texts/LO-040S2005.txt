S. 2005

MR. REYNALDO J. DELA CRUZ
1850 M. Hizon Street,
Sta. Cruz, Manila

Dear Mr. Dela Cruz:

This pertains to your letter requesting this Department to appoint you as
Barangay Kagawad in view of the demise of one of the members of your
sangguniang barangay.

In reply thereto, may we invite your attention to Section 45(a)(3) of the Local
Government Code of 1991 which provides for the proper procedure in filling up
permanent vacancies in the Sangguniang. It states that:

"Section 45(a)(3) - Permanent vacancies in the Sangguniang
where automatic successions provided above (Section 44) do not
apply shall be filled by appointment in the following manner:

xxx xxx xxx

(3) The city or municipal mayor, in the case of sangguniang
barangay, upon recommendation of the sangguniang barangay
concerned.

Premises considered, it is clear in the above-cited provision that this
Department has no authority to appoint you as barangay kagawad in your
barangay. The appointing authority to fill up vacancies in the sangguniang
barangay is the city/municipal mayor subject to the recommendation of the
sangguniang barangay where the vacancy occurred.

Hope we have enlightened you on the matter.

Very truly yours,

ANGELO T. REYES
Secretary
