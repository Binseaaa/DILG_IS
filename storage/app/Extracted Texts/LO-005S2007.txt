DR. MICHAELITO L. BENOZA
Punong Barangay
Marulas, Valenzuela City

Dear Punong Barangay Benoza:

This pertains to your letter requesting our legal opinion on whether or not you can appoint an interim or acting barangay treasurer.

You stated that your incumbent barangay treasurer is subject to investigation by the Commission on Audit in AOM No. 2006-0728-031-Marulas for unremitted collection in the amount of P303,754.00. You further stated that your barangay treasurer is not anymore reporting to you and has not submitted reports you required him to do so.

Please be informed that appointments are issued to vacant offices. Considering that there is no vacancy in the barangay treasurer position, you cannot issue an appointment of an acting treasurer. The mere fact that the barangay treasurer is under investigation by the Commission on Audit would not render his office vacant.

In the light of his alleged absences and in order not to create a vacuum in the office, you may, however, designate any barangay official as Officer-in-Charge in the Office of the Barangay Treasurer.

Along this line, please be informed that designation and appointment are not the same. Appointment is a mode of original entry to government service, while designation is one given to a person already in the public service or organization and is simply directed to perform additional tasks, functions and duties.

Hope we've guided you accordingly.

Very truly yours,

WENCELITO T. ANDANAR
Undersecretary
