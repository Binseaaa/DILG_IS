Dear Dir. Quilaman:

This refers to your request for this Departmentâ€™s opinion on the following issues, to wit:

1. "Will the reduction of the population in the mother/original barangay as a result of its division for the creation of tribal barangay cause or result to the abolition of the mother/original barangay?

2. Can a tribal barangay adopt indigenous political systems, leadership structures and form of governance?

3. Can a tribal barangay adopt indigenous justice system, conflict resolution institutions, and peace building process?

4. Can a tribal barangay general other sources of revenue aside from those provided for in RA 7160?"

As to your first query, Sections 385 and 386 of the Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160) respectively provide:

"SEC. 385. Manner of Creation.- A barangay may be created, divided, merged, abolished, or its boundary substantially altered, by law or by an ordinance of the sangguniang panlalawigan or sangguniang panlungsod, subject to approval by a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite to be conducted by the COMELEC in the local government unit or units directly affected within such period of time as may be determined by the law or ordinance creating said barangay. In the case of the creation of barangays by the sangguniang panlalawigan, the recommendation of the sangguniang bayan concerned shall be necessary."

"SEC. 386. Requisites for Creation.- (a) A barangay may be created out of a contiguous territory which has a population of at least two thousand (2,000) inhabitants as certified by the National Statistics Office except in cities and municipalities within Metro Manila and other Metropolitan Political Subdivisions or in highly urbanized cities where such territory shall have a certified population of at least five thousand (5,000) inhabitants: Provided, That the creation thereof shall not reduce the population of the original barangay or barangays to less than the minimum requirement prescribed herein.

To enhance the delivery of basic services in the indigenous cultural minorities, barangays may be created in such communities by an act of congress, notwithstanding the above requirements." (underlining ours)

Hence, barangays may be created by law passed by Congress or by an ordinance passed by either the Sanggunian Panlungsod or Sanggunian Panlalawigan having territorial jurisdiction thereof, as the case may be. May it be emphasized that the requirements, such as population, for the creation of a barangay if it involves indigenous cultural minorities, may be disregarded when Congress itself creates the barangay. However, if a barangay is to be created by either the Sanggunian Panlungsod or Sanggunian Panlalawigan, the latter bodies can not set aside the requirements set forth under RA 7160 for the creation of a barangay.

Hence, insofar as the creation of tribal barangays are concerned, Congress is not bound by the requirement that the creation of the new barangay shall not reduce the population of the original barangay or barangays to less than the minimum set by the Local Government Code.

Your second, third and fourth queries shall be answered in seriatim. However, at the outset, please be informed that RA 7160, the general law applicable to all local government units and its local officials, sets the technical and political structure and mode of governance of all local government units, barangays included. Simply put, RA 7160 is the basic law which must be considered by all local government units, that include barangays whether tribal or not.

On the other hand, RA 8731 or the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act concerns the recognition of the customs and traditions of the countryâ€™s indigenous citizens and the latterâ€™s right to preserve their respective customs and traditions vis-Ã -vis the exercise of their political rights. Please note that the exercise of customs and traditions are not limitless, as otherwise, indigenous communities would already rise above the State that created them. Precisely, under Article 11 of the New Civil Code, it is so provided that customs which are contrary to law, public order or public policy shall not be countenanced. It is without doubt that it was never the intent of Congress to create another sovereign within the sovereign Republic, through the enactment of RA 8371.
