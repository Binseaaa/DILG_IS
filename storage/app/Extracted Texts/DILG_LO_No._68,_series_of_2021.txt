DILG OPINION No. 67 s.2021

10 May 2021

HON. FLORENCIO G. SALES, JR.
Sangguniang Bayan Member
Municipality of Bangui

Province of Ilocos Norte

Dear SB Member Sales, Jr.:

This has reference to your letter dated 19 October 2020, regarding the
enactment of Municipal Ordinance Nos. 11-03-2020 and 11-02-2020,
entitled “AN ORDINANCE MANDATING THE PROPER USE OF FACE
MASKS OR FACE COVERINGS IN PUBLIC PLACES, AND IMPOSING
PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THEREOF” and “AN ORDINANCE
PROHIBITING ANY FORM OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MEDICAL
AND NON-MEDICAL FRONTLINERS AND PERSONS CATEGORIZED
AS “SUSPECT”, “PROBABLE”, AND “CONFIRMED/RECOVERED OR
TREATED” FOR CORONA VIRUS 2019 (COVID-19) IN MUNICIPALITY
OF BANGUI, ILOCOS NORTE”, respectively, by the Sangguniang
Bayan of Bangui, Ilocos Norte.

The above-specified Municipal Ordinances were declared partly invalid by
the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Ilocos Norte through the issuance of
Joint Committee Report of the Committee on Laws, Rules, Ethics and
Privileges and Committee on Health, Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Ilocos
Norte, dated 14 September 2020, with a finding that the above-mentioned
Municipal Ordinances are invalid in part, as the penalties imposed in the
said municipal ordinances are inconsistent with the penalties imposed in
Provincial Ordinance No. 22-2020 dated April 20, 2020, entitled “AN
ORDINANCE IMPOSING PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF
EXECUTIVE ORDERS, ISSUANCES AND DIRECTOVES ISSUED IN
RELATION TO PROCLAMATION NO. 922 DECLARING THE
PHILIPPINES UNDER A STATE OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY BY
REASON OF THE CORONA VIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19), AS

AMENDED”.

Hence, your request for clarification and guidance.

At the outset, it is imperative to point out that Section 468(a)(1)(i) of the
Local Gevernment Code of 1991 has vested unto the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan the power to review all ordinances approved by the
sangguniang component cities and municipalities and executive orders
issued by the mayors of said component units to determine whether these
are within the scope of the prescribed powers of the sanggunian and of
the mayor.

Corollary thereto, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan is bound to limit its
review of the ordinance to the requirements set forth by the provisions of
the LGC per Section 468(a)(1)(i) in relation to Section 56(c) thereof, viz:

“(c) If the sangguniang panlalawigan finds that such an ordinance or
resolution is beyond the power conferred upon the sangguniang
panlungsod or sangguniang bayan concerned, it shall declare such
ordinance or resolution invalid in whole or in part. The sangguniang
panlalawigan shall enter its action in the minutes and shall advise the
corresponding city or municipal authorities of the action it has taken.”

At this juncture, the case of Moday vs. Court of Appeals is instructive. In
the said case, the Supreme Court, citing the case of Velazco vs. Blas has
ruled that:

“The only ground upon which a provincial board may declare any
municipal resolution, ordinance, or order invalid is when such
resolution, ordinance or order is ‘beyond the power conferred upon the
council or president making the same.’ Absolutely, no other ground is
recognized by the law. A strictly legal question is before the provincial
board in its consideration of a municipal resolution, ordinance or order.
The provincial (board’s) disapproval of any resolution, ordinance or
order must be premised specifically upon the fact that such resolution,
ordnance or order is outside the scope of the legal powers conferred
by law. If a provincial board passes these limits, it usurps the legislative
functions of the municipal council, or president. Such has been the
consistent course of executive authority”.

Hence, applying the foregoing principles, the ultimate question to be
resolved herein is, did the Sangguniang Bayan of Bangui, Ilocos Norte act
beyond the powers conferred upon it, by imposing penalties that are
inconsistent with the penalties imposed in Provincial Ordinance No. 22-

2020.

In relation thereto, we emphasize that the Sangguniang Bayan, as the
legislative body of the municipality has the power to approve ordinances
imposing a fine not exceeding Two thousand five hundred pesos (P2,500)

or an imprisonment for a period not exceeding six (6) months, or both in
the discretion of the court, for the violation of municipal ordinance.

Since the penalties imposed under Municipal Ordinance Nos. 11-03-2020
and 11-02-2020 are within the prescribed amount as stated above, the
Department is of the considered view that said municipal ordinances are
not inconsistent with Provincial Ordinance No. 22-2020, otherwise, the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan usurps the legislative functions of the
sangguniang bayan.

This opinion is being rendered without prejudice to any contrary opinion
of competent authorities and the courts.

We hope to have assisted you accordingly. Thank you.

Very truly yours,

Authority of the Secretary:
