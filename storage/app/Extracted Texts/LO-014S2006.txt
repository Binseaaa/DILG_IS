DILG OPINION NO. 14 S. 2006

VICE MAYOR ERNESTO MERCADO
Makati City

Dear Sir:

This refers to your request for "authority" from this Department for your Local
Government Unit to use a portion of your Calamity Fund to finance the construction of
a school classroom or barangay hall at Barangay Guinsaugon, St. Bernard, Southern
Leyte, in view of the tragedy that occurred in the latter.

Please be informed that in lieu of an "authority", may we render an opinion thereon.
Let it be noted that Section 5 (b) (b.2) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of
Republic Act No. 9185 (An Act Amending Section 324 [d] of Republic Act No. 7160,
otherwise known as the Local Government Code, provides that:

"A portion of the Calamity Fund may also be authorized to
be used by the LGU concerned to provide financial assistance to
other LGUs whose area or portion thereof had been declared under
the state of calamity by its sanggunian."

Ergo, your city may utilize a portion of your Calamity Fund allocation as financial
assistance to other LGUs provided that a state of calamity had been declared in th
latter's area or portion thereof by its concerned sanggunian.

We hope to have addressed your concern accordingly.

Very truly yours,
By Authority of the Secretary:

PASCUAL V. VERON-CRUZ, JR.
Head Executive Assistant
