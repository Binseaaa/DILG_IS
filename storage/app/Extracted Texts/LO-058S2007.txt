OFFICE OF THE UNDERSECRETARY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

July 23, 2007

ATTY. SANCHO A. ABASTA, JR.
Board Member
Province of Zambales

Dear Sir:

This refers to your letter seeking our clarification on whether or not a lawyer-Board Member of a province may be allowed to practice law during his/her term of office.

In reply thereto, we would like to respectfully invite your attention to the second paragraph of Section 90 of the Local Government Code which, in part, provides:

"SEC. 90. (b) Sangguniang members may practice their professions, engage in any occupation, or teach in school except during session hours: Provided, That sangguniang members who are also members of the Bar shall not:

(1) Appear as counsel before any court in any civil case wherein a local government unit or any office, agency, or instrumentality of the government is the adverse party;

(2) Appear as counsel in any criminal case wherein an officer or employee of the national or local government is accused of an offense committed in relation to his office;

(3) Collect any fee for their appearance in administrative proceedings involving the local government unit of which he is an official; and

(4) Use property and personnel of the Government except when the sangguniang member concerned is defending the interest of the Government.

In view thereof, it is thus clear that lawyer members of the sangguniang are allowed to practice their profession subject to the limitations listed or enumerated therein.

Hope we have enlightened you on the matter.

Very truly yours,

AUSTIER A. PANADERO
