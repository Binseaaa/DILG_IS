Dear Atty. Mirador:

This refers to your request for our legal opinion on whether or not your client Amec Services Ltd., a subcontractor of Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. (SPEX), a petroleum service contractor of the Government of the Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 87, as amended, is exempt from the payment of local business tax. In seeking our opinion, you presented to us your arguments as well as the relevant opinions rendered by other agencies on the matter.

After going over the same and based on our own independent research, please be informed that we join your understanding and those of the other agencies that, indeed, your client is exempt from payment of local business tax. We are of the view that Section 1 of Presidential Decree 1354 squarely applies, it being unequivocal and self-explanatory. There being no provision in the Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160) expressly repealing Section 1 of PD 1354 which grant tax exemption on subcontractors like your client SPEX, we therefore concur with your view and that of the opinion rendered by the Bureau of Local Government Finance-Department of Finance (BLGF-DOF), that the Local Government Code of 1991 did not withdraw the tax exemption previously given to SPEX. Well-settled is the rule in statutory construction that repeal by implication is not favored and before such repeal will be decreed, the intention to repeal must be clear and manifest.

We hope that we have addressed your concern accordingly.

Very truly yours,

AUSTERE A. PANADERO
Undersecretary
