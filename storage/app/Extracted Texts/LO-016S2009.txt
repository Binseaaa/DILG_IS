MR. CARLITO T. TARIMAN
10 Faisal St., Filinvest II
Quezon City

Dear Mr. Tariman:

This pertains to your letter seeking clarification on the proper
interpretation of Article 110(d) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations
of the Local Government Code which provides, "If no action has been
taken by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan within thirty (30) days after
submission of such ordinances or resolutions, the same shall be presumed
consistent with the law, and therefore, valid".

Your inquiry is premised on the following facts, which we deem best
to reproduce for better appreciation, viz:

â€¢ On 19 January 2009, the Sangguniang Bayan of Virac, Catanduanes
approved Municipal Resolution No. 2009-1-006 enacting Municipal
Ordinance No. 2009-01, reclassifying the two (2) properties situated at
Virac, Catanduanes, from residential to commercial areas.

â€¢ On 29 January 2009, the Office of the Sangguniang Bayan of Virac
endorsed Municipal Resolution No. 2009-01-006 enacting Municipal
Ordinance No. 2009-01 to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of
Catanduanes for review.

â€¢ On 18 February 2009, in its 7th regular session, the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan of Catanduanes, upon motion of a member, voted to
declare the above Resolution and Ordinance as invalid for being ultra
vires.

â€¢ On 19 February 2009, Mr. Leo B. Bisencio, Legislative Staff Officer I of the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Catanduanes, wrote a letter addressed
to Vice Mayor and Sangguniang Bayan Presiding Officer Roy V.
Laynes, informing that the subject ordinance had been considered
and reviewed by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and was found to be
"defective and invalid".

â€¢ The next regular session of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of
Catanduanes was scheduled last 25 February 2009 but no session was
held for allegedly lack of quorum. Thus, the Minutes of the 7th regular
session of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan held last 18 February 2009,
which continued the deliberation and voting declaring the Resolution
and Ordinance as invalid, was not considered nor approved.

â€¢ 28 February 2009 is the 30th day on which the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan has to take action on the review of the above Resolution
and Ordinance under Article 110 (d) of the IRR of the Local
Government Code.

We take it that you are now in a quandary vis-Ã -vis the above-
stated provision of the Local Government Code as to whether:

1. The 30 day prescribed period is absolute so as to be
reckoned with from the date of receipt by the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan regardless of the intervening actions taken in
between by the body such as referrals to committee,
committee hearings/amendments; or;

2. The prescriptive period is automatically extinguished by the
intervening actions taken by the august body as enumerated
above.

In resolving your query, may we first cite specific provisions of the
Local Government Code of 1991 [RA 7160] relevant thereto, to wit:

"SEC. 56. Review of Component City and
Municipal Ordinances or Resolutions by the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan.-- (a) Within three (3) days
after approval, the Secretary to the Sangguniang
panlungsod or Sangguniang Bayan shall forward to the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan for review, copies of
approval ordinances and the resolutions approving the
