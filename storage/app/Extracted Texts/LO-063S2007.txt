MAYOR CESAR SULIBIT
Liliw, Laguna
Dear Mayor Sulibit:
This pertains to your letter seeking our legal opinion regarding the
revocation of the appointment of an Office for Senior Citizen Affairs head
where the grounds and the process of discharging an incumbent
appointee are not specifically provided under RA No. 9257, its
Implementing Rules and Regulations and other related laws.
In reply thereto, may we invite your attention to Section 6 of RA
9257 which provides that:
"SECTION 6 - THE OFFICE FOR SENIOR CITIZEN AFFAIRS (OSCA) - There shall be established in all cities and
municipalities an OSCA to be headed by a senior citizen who
shall be appointed by the mayor for a term of three (3) years
without reappointment from a list of three (3) nominees of the
sangguniang pambayanan or the sangguniang bayan. The
head of the OSCA shall be assisted by the City Social Welfare
and Development Officer or by the Municipal Social Welfare
and Development Officer in coordination with the Social
Welfare and Development Office."
In view of the above-cited provision, it is clear that the term of office
of the head of the Office for Senior Citizen Affairs is fixed by law, that is,
for three years without reappointment. Well-settled is the rule in statutory
construction that when the law speaks in clear and categorical language,
there is no reason for interpretation or construction but only application.
In that regard, it bears to emphasize that once the law fixed the
term of office, the holder thereof enjoys security of tenure. Such being the
case no officer shall be removed sooner than the end of the term except
for cause, as provided by law.
Hope we have enlightened you on the matter.
Very truly yours,
AUSTERE A. PANADERO
Undersecretary
