MR. PEDRITO A. EISMA
MR. RICHARD S. BROWN
City Councilors
Isabela City, Basilan

Gentlemen:

This refers to your letter requesting this Departmentâ€™s opinion on the following queries, to wit:

1. Was the letter of the Mayor dated January 03, 2008 recalling her signature in Ordinance No. 07-251, in the nature of a VETO as provided in Section 55 of the Local Government Code?

2. Did the letter of the Mayor dated January 3, 2008 recalling her signature in Ordinance No. 07-251 validly suspend the implementation of the 2008 Annual General Fund Budget?

3. Was the disbursement for the operation of the city government beginning January 2008 using as a basis the 2007 Annual General Fund Budget legally tenable? Is this a case of illegal disbursement?

4. Was the repeal/deletion of Section 2. Special Provisions (a) and (b) in Ordinance No. 07-251, through an oral manifestation and motion without observing the requisite procedure as provided in the Internal Rules and Procedures of the Sangguniang Panlungsod legal? Can the SP members who voted in favor of this measure be subjected to legal action?

Before addressing the above queries, we deem it proper to re-state in gist the antecedent facts, viz:

On December 13, 2007, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Isabela, Basilan, enacted Appropriation Ordinance No. 07-251, representing the Cityâ€™s General Fund Budget in the amount of P286,439,971.20;

The said Appropriation Ordinance was submitted to the Office of the Mayor on December 26, 2007 for approval and signature, whereupon, the said ordinance was returned to the Sangguniang Panlungsod on December 28, 2007 with the signature of the Mayor signifying the latterâ€™s approval thereon;

The Acting Secretary of the Sangguniang Panlungsod then, on January 3, 2008, distributed copies of the approved ordinance to the Cityâ€™s Department Heads and transmitted a copy thereof to the Sangguniang Panlawigan for review;

However, as intimated, on even date, the City Budget Officer retrieved the duly signed ordinance from the Sangguniang Panlungsod and that reportedly, all other copies distributed to the Offices of the Cityâ€™s Department Heads were also retrieved;

On January 7, 2008, the Sangguniang Panlungsod, through the City Vice-Mayor, received a letter dated January 3, 2008 from the City Mayor which stated that the latter was recalling her signature inadvertently affixed on Ordinance No. 07-251 and â€œthe further implementation of the provision embodied therein and appertaining theretoâ€;

During the January 17, 2008 regular session of the Sangguniang Panlungsod, the Chairman of the Committee on Finance, Ways and Means, orally manifested to amend Ordinance No. 07-251, and despite your objection, the said manifestation was approved via 9 affirmative votes as against 3 negative votes.

We now address your queries.
