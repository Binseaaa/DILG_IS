DILC OPINION NO.12 S. 2005 17 February 2005

MR. LUIS C. UTULO

General Manager

Infanta (Quezon) Water District

Infanta, Quezon

Dear Mr. Utolo:

This refers to your request for this Department's opinion on whether or not a losing vice-mayoralty candidate during the 10 May 2004 elections may be appointed to a water district, the latter being a government-owned or controlled corporation, within the one-year prohibition contemplated under Section 94 (b) of the Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160).

We reply in the negative.

Section 94 (b) of the Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160) explicitly provides: "Except for losing candidates in barangay elections, no candidate who lost in any election shall, within one (1) year after such election, be appointed to any office in the government or any government-owned or controlled corporations or in any of their subsidiaries".

It is, therefore, our opinion that the appointment of Engr. Edilberto M. Buado, a losing vice-mayoralty candidate, as member of the Board of Directors of a GOCC (Government-Owned and Controlled Corporation) on 14 December 2004, is violative of the provision of RA 7160 as stated above, since said appointment fell within the one-year prohibitive period for appointing losing candidates (except barangay candidates) into the government service.

We hope to have enlightened you on the matter.

Very truly yours,

Legal:87/La
