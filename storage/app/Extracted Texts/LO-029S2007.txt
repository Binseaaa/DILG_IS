MR. MANUEL P. SOLOMON

Runong Barangay

Barangay Tunasan, Muntinlupa City

Dear Sir:

This pertains to your letter requesting for a legal opinion on the validity and enforceability of Barangay Ordinance No. 05-04 dated 21 February 2005, which authorized the increase of the allowances of barangay officials of your barangay in relation to the enactment of RA 9340, also known as "An Act Amending Republic Act No. 9164 Resetting the Barangay and SK Elections and For Other Purposes".

By way of a background, you stated that your aforesaid barangay ordinance provided for the increase in the monthly allowance of mandatory appointive and elective barangay officials. That based on Section 391 (10) of the Local Government Code, the said increase shall take effect only after the term of office of the incumbent elective barangay officials who approved the same, i.e. after 30 November 2005. You emphasized that the term of office of the incumbent barangay officials of Tunasan expired on 30 November 2005 as provided for under Section 1 of RA 9164 but on 22 September 2005, RA 9340 was passed and approved amending RA 9164, extending the term of office of barangay officials by postponing the supposed 31 October 2005 barangay elections to the last Monday of October 2007.

On 28 February 2006, said ordinance was transmitted to the City Council Muntinlupa City for review but the said Council failed to take any action thereon within the required period of thirty (30) days from receipt thereof. Hence, you are of the view that the same is already deemed approved pursuant to Section 57 (b) of the Local Government Code.
