Office of the Sanggunian Bayan
Esperanza, Masbate

Dear Mr. Conag:

This refers to your letter seeking our legal opinion on the following issues, to wit:

1) Whether or not the ABC President is considered resigned upon filing of certificate of candidacy to run as regular member of the sanggunian bayan.

2) Whether or not he/she can still claim as an incumbent ex-officio member of the sanggunian bayan being the ABC president after filing the certificate of candidacy to run as regular member of the sanggunian bayan.

In reply thereto, please find the attached advisory on the effects of filing of certificate of candidacy dated January 12, 2007.

Please be informed further that since an ABC President, who is necessarily a Punong Barangay, is not considered resigned as Punong barangay upon the filing of his certificate of candidacy for another position, he can retain such Punong Barangay position in case he loses in his election bid. He shall likewise remain as Liga President unless sooner removed as Liga President pursuant to the Liga ng mga barangay Constitution and By-Laws.

We hope we have guided you accordingly.

Very truly yours.
