MAYOR FERNANDO Q. MIGUEL
Koronadal City, South Cotabato

Dear Mayor Miguel:

This has reference to your earlier letter seeking our legal opinion on several queries pertaining to your enactment of that Cityâ€™s Annual Budget.

Per your letter, the Sangguniang Panlungsod approved Appropriation Ordinance No. 12, Series of 2007 on 28 December 2007, CY 2008 Annual Budget. On 02 January 2008, the Sangguniang Panlungsod transmitted the same to your Office for your consideration. You approved said Ordinance but vetoed the item on Intelligence Services. Immediately thereafter, you transmitted said Appropriation Ordinance, together with the veto message, to the Sangguniang Panlungsod so that the latter may consider your veto message. Instead of overriding the vetoed item, the Sangguniang Panlungsod transmitted the Appropriation Ordinance, together with the veto message, to the Sangguniang Panlawigan for the latterâ€™s review. With such transmittal, you are of the view that the Sangguniang Panlungsod has already completed its legislative action in the adoption, passage and approval of the said Appropriation Ordinance and you can thus invoke Section 55 (b) of RA 7160, which provides that â€œthe vetoed item or items shall not take effect unless the sanggunian overrides the veto in the manner herein provided; otherwise, the item or items in the appropriation ordinance of the previous year corresponding to those vetoed, if any, shall be deemed re-enactedâ€. On 23 January 2008, you directed the City Budget Officer to release the full amount of five million pesos (Php 5,000,000.00) appropriation for Intelligence Services as this is the budget allocation for intelligence services in CY 2007 Annual Budget. Surprisingly, on 04 February 2008, the Sangguniang Panlungsod, with a vote of eight (8) members in favor and three (3) members against passed and approved SP Resolution No. 08, Series of 2008, entitled: "A Resolution Overriding the Item Veto of the City Mayor, Hon. Fernando Q. Miguel, on the Approved Appropriation for Intelligence Services Amounting to Seven Hundred Thousand Pesos (Php 700,000.00) as embodied in the Annual Budget CY 2008 of the City of Koronadal". On 05 February 2008, the Sangguniang Panlungsod transmitted SP Resolution No. 08, Series of 2008, to your office for information.

In view of the foregoing, you are now asking our legal opinion on the following queries, to wit:

1) Are the procedures in the passage and approval of Appropriation Ordinance No. 12, series of 2007, including the item veto you made, consistent with existing laws?

2) Does the fact that the Sangguniang Panlungsod transmitted Appropriation Ordinance No. 12 to the Sangguniang Panlawigan without making the necessary comments on the vetoed item mean that the said Ordinance has been approved in toto by the Sangguniang Panlungsod?

Is Appropriation Ordinance No. 12, including the vetoed item for Intelligence Services, effective for all legal intents and purposes? Is it legal to invoke the re-enacted clause as prescribed in Section 55 (b) of RA 7160, thus, increasing the appropriations for intelligence services from Php 700,000 to Php 5,000,000.00?

3) Are you entitled by law to cause the immediate release of the Intelligence Fund amounting to Php 5,000,000.00 pending review of the Appropriation Ordinance by the Sangguniang Panlawigan?

4) Was the passage by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of SP Resolution No. 08, Series of 2008 overriding the Item Veto on Intelligence Services proper and within the bounds of law, considering that said body has previously transmitted the Appropriation Ordinance to the Sangguniang Panlawigan for review? Are the eight (8) votes mustered by the Sangguniang Panlungsod overriding the Item Veto of the Undersigned consistent with the 2/3 votes as what is prescribed in Section 55 (c) of the Local Government Code of 1991?

Before dealing squarely with your queries, which we will answer jointly, we deem it proper to invite your attention to the pertinent provisions of the Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160) applicable in the case at hand, to wit:

-Section 319

"SECTION 319. Legislative Authorization of the Budget.- On or before the end of the current fiscal year, the sanggunian concerned shall enact, through an ordinance, the annual budget of the local government unit for the ensuing fiscal year on the basis of the estimates of income and expenditures submitted by the local chief executive."

-Section 54

"SECTION 54. Approval of Ordinances.- (a) Every ordinance enacted by the sangguniang panlawigan, sangguniang panlungsod, or sangguniang bayan shall be presented to the provincial governor or city or municipal
