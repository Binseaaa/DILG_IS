ATTY. JOHN D. BALASYA
Mayor, Municipality of Kayapa
Nueva Vizcaya

Dear Aity. Balasya:

This has reference to your request for this Department’s legal opinion anent
your intent to purchase a second hand four wheel drive (4x4) six (6) cylinder vehicle
vis-a-vis Administrative Order No. 233 entitled “Reiterating the Prohibition on the
Acquisition and Use of Luxury Vehicles and Directing Revisions of Guidelines on
Government Motor Vehicles Acquisition’, dated August 1, 2008 issued by Her
Excellency President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

As stated in your letter, your intention to purchase a (4x4) 6 cylinder vehicle is
impelled by the need to traverse the mountainous terrain of your municipality.

In reply thereto, please be informed that the primordial goal which
Administrative Order 433 intends to achieve is the conservation of this country’s fuel
consumption so as to minimize our dependence on imported fuels. Precisely, the
President issued the prohibition on the purchase of luxury vehicles as the latter,
undoubtedly are known gas-guzzlers.

Be that as it may, the prohibition made by Administrative Order 233 is not one
of an absolute nature, because section 9.0 thereof still allows the purchase of luxury

vehicles by Local Government Units provided that prior approval from the Office of
the President is sought.

Thus, we are of the opinion that your municipality may purchase the intended
vehicle stated in your letter, but only after having secured the imprimatur of the
Office of the President.

We hope we have enlightened you on the matter.

CL. yours,

AUSTERE A. PANADERO
Undersecretary { ye
