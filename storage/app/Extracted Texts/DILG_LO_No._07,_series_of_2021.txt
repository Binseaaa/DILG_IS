PUNONG BARANGAY ARIEL B. LOMBOS
Barangay Aniban V
Bacoor, Cavite

Dear Punong Barangay Lombos:

This has reference to your letter dated 08 July 2020 requesting for
this Department to fill up the vacancy in the Office of Sangguniang
Barangay (SB), Barangay Aniban V, Bacoor, Cavite by reason of the
apprehension of SB member Dante Morales for violation of Sections 5 and
11 of Republic Act No. 9165.

Let it be noted that a previous opinion has been rendered by DILG
Region IV-A dated 04 February 2020, wherein it was opined that SB
member Morales cannot as yet return to his position as such, and continue
to serve as a regular member of the Sangguniang Barangay, pending the
approval of his application for probation.

Hence, your request to fill up the aforesaid vacancy pursuant to
Administrative Order No. 15, Series of 2018.

Foremost, pursuant to Section 46(a) of Republic Act No. 7160,
otherwise known as the “Local Government Code of 1991” (LGC),
temporary vacancy exists when the local chief executive (governor,
city/municipal mayor, or punong barangay) is temporarily incapacitated to
perform his duties for physical or legal reasons, such as but not limited to,
leave of absence, travel abroad, and suspension from office.

This Department in several occasions, among those is DILG
Opinion No. 20, Series of 2013, had interpreted Section 46(a) of the LGC
in this wise: “wx the Warrant of Arrest issued by the RTC against the
accused coupled with his absence and non-performance of his duties and
functions can be considered a “physical or legal reason” under Section
46(a) of Republic Act No. 7160 which temporarily incapacitates him from
performing his duties xxx.”

Applying by analogy, pursuant to Section 46(a) of the LGC, SB
Member Morales is considered temporarily incapacitated to perform his
duties and functions as Sangguniang Barangay Member for legal reasons
(his apprehension) coupled with his absence and non-performance of his
duties and functions (as a result of his apprehension). His pending
application for probation will not alter such temporary incapacity.

Probation, as defined under Section 3 of Presidential Decree No.
968, as amended, is a disposition under which an accused, after
conviction and sentence, is released subject to the conditions imposed by
the court and to the supervision of a probation officer. In probation, the
execution of the sentence is suspended, including the suspension
of the execution of its accessory penalties.

It is not the application for probation per se that will pave the way for
the suspension of the execution of sentence but the grant thereof by the
court. It is only when accused SB Morales is actually placed under
probation by the court that he will enjoy the benefit thereof.

Having established the temporary vacancy, please be informed of
DILG Memorandum Circular No. 2019-21, dated 12 February 2019,
entitled “Operational Guidelines and Rules in Implementing Administrative
Order No.15, Series of 2018”, wherein it provides for the process,
requirements, and procedure in filling up the vacancy in the sangguniang
barangay, to wit:

“C. Temporary Vacancies in the Sanggunian

XXXX

3. In case the sanggunian concerned can no longer come up with the
required recommendation due to lack of quorum, the temporary
vacancy/ies shall be filled in accordance with paragraph D below of this
guideline.

4. Temporary vacancies in the sangguniang barangay shall also be
filled up in accordance with Item 3 above if sanggunian barangay is still
constituting a quorum. Otherwise, the temporary vacancies shall be filled
up in the manner provided for in paragraph D below of this guideline.

Accordingly, for the position of SB member Morales to be filled up,
the above-mentioned procedure and requirements must first be complied
with before this Department can validly designate a sangguniang
barangay member. Thus, the sangguniang barangay, if still constituting a
quorum, must submit their recommendation to the Department.

Nonetheless, it must be noted that pending the completion of
selection and designation processes referred to above, the remaining
local elective officials shall administer the day-to-day operations of the
concerned local government unit to ensure continuous and effective

delivery of public services therein.

We hope to have addressed your concerns accordingly. Thank you.

BACKGROUND

Pursuant to the letter of Punong Barangay (PB) Ariel B. Lombos, a
temporary vacancy occurred in the Office of Sangguniang Barangay (SB),
Barangay Aniban V, Bacoor, Cavite, by reason of the apprehension of SB
member Dante Morales for violation of Sections 5 and 11 of Republic Act
No. 9165.

Let it be noted that a previous opinion has been rendered by DILG
Region IV-A dated 04 February 2020, wherein it was opined that SB
Member Morales cannot as yet return to his position as such, and continue
to serve as a regular member of the Sangguniang Barangay, pending the
approval of his application for probation.

Hence, PB Lombos now requests this Department to fill up the
aforesaid vacancy pursuant to Administrative Order No. 15, Series of
2018.

THIS LEVEL’S COMMENTS AND/OR RECOMMENDATION

Foremost, pursuant to Section 46(a) of Republic Act No. 7160,
otherwise known as the “Local Government Code of 1991” (LGC),
temporary vacancy exists when the local chief executive (governor,
city/municipal mayor, or punong barangay) is temporarily incapacitated to
perform his duties for physical or legal reasons, such as but not limited to,
leave of absence, travel abroad, and suspension from office.

This Department in several occasions, among those is DILG
Opinion No. 20, Series of 2013, had interpreted Section 46(a) of the LGC
in this wise: “x. the Warrant of Arrest issued by the RTC against the
accused coupled with his absence and non-performance of his duties and
functions can be considered a “physical or legal reason” under Section
46(a) of Republic Act No. 7160 which temporarily incapacitates him from
performing his duties xxx.”

Applying by analogy, pursuant to Section 46(a) of the LGC, SB
Member Morales is considered temporarily incapacitated to perform his
duties and functions as Sangguniang Barangay Member for legal reasons
(his apprehension) coupled with his absence and non-performance of his
duties and functions (as a result of his apprehension). His pending
application for probation will not alter such temporary incapacity.

Probation, as defined under Section 3 of Presidential Decree No.
968, as amended, is a disposition under which an accused, after

conviction and sentence, is released subject to the conditions imposed by
the court and to the supervision of a probation officer. In probation, the
execution of the sentence is suspended, including the suspension
of the execution of its accessory penalties.

lt is not the application for probation per se that will pave the way for
the suspension of the execution of sentence but the grant thereof by the
court. It is only when accused SB Morales is actually placed under
probation by the court that he will enjoy the benefit thereof.

Having established the temporary vacancy, please be informed of
DILG Memorandum Circular No. 2079-21, dated 12 February 2019,
entitled “Operational Guidelines and Rules in Implementing Administrative
Order No.15, Series of 2018”, wherein it provides for the process,
requirements, and procedure in filling up the vacancy in the sangguniang
barangay, to wit:

“C. Temporary Vacancies in the Sanggunian

XXXX

3. In case the sanggunian concerned can no longer come up with the
required recommendation due to lack of quorum, the temporary
vacancy/ies shall be filled in accordance with paragraph D below of this
guideline.

4. Temporary vacancies in the sangguniang barangay shall also be
filled up in accordance with Item 3 above if sanggunian barangay is still
constituting a quorum. Otherwise, the temporary vacancies shall be filled
up in the manner provided for in paragraph D below of this guideline.

Accordingly, for the position of SB member Morales to be filled up,
the above-mentioned procedure and requirements must first be complied
with before this Department can validly designate a sangguniang
barangay member. Thus, the sangguniang barangay, if still constituting a
quorum, must submit their recommendation to the Department.

Nonetheless, it must be noted that pending the completion of
selection and designation processes referred to above, the remaining
local elective officials shall administer the day-to-day operations of the
concerned local government unit to ensure continuous and effective
delivery of public services therein.
