Sir:

This refers to your request for this Department's legal opinion on whether or
not a Sangguniang Bayan resolution authorizing a loan application needs to be
approved and confirmed by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.

We reply in the negative.

Please be advised that the authority of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan to
review the acts of its component municipalities is limited to reviewing only (1)
ordinances or (2) resolutions approving local development plans and public
investment programs, per the provisions of Sec. 56(a) of the Local Government
Code of 1991 (RA 7160).

The review authority of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan does not extend
to resolutions enacted by its component municipalities which authorize the
latter's Mayor to enter into a contract of loan. Likewise, the law (RA 7160)
neither requires such resolutions to be approved nor confirmed by the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan.

We hope we have enlightened you on the matter.

TERESITA CASTILLO
Undersecretary
