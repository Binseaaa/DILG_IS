ATTY. ARVIN T. AMATA
Provincial Legal Officer
Provincial Capitol Building
Virac, Catanduanes

Dear Atty. Amata:

This has reference to your earlier letter seeking our legal opinion on
whether or not you, while serving as the Provincial Legal Officer of
Catanduanes, still need to secure an authority to practice your profession
as a lawyer from this Department, in addition to the authority to practice
previously given to you by the Provincial Governor.

Per your representation when you came to our Office, you already
went to the Civil Service Commission (CSC) where you posed the same
query. According to you, the CSC opined that the authority to practice
previously given to you by the Provincial Governor, being the head of the
provincial government to which you were appointed, is already an enough
authorization to practice your profession as a lawyer.

In this regard, please be informed that the President exercises only
general supervision over local governments and its officials and per
Administrative Order No. 267, dated 18 February 1992, certain general
supervisory powers of the President was delegated to the Secretary of this
Department. Accordingly, there is no more need for you to secure an
authority to practice your profession as a lawyer from this Department.
The authority given by the Governor, as local chief executive exercising
control over you, would already suffice.

We hope that we have addressed your concern accordingly.

Very truly yours,

AUSTERE A. PANADERO
Acting Secretary
