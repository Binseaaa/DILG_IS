DILG OPINION No. 50 s.2021
22 April 2021
HON. DANILO E. SUAREZ
Governor
Quezon Province
Dear Governor Suarez:
This refers to your letter dated 12 April 2021 regarding your predicament in the enactment of the Annual Appropriation Ordinance of Quezon Province.
Per your letter, the annual budget of the Province of Quezon was re- enacted on 31 March 2021 after the disapproval thereof by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. Said disapproval of the annual budget by the august body was based on the recommendation made by the Special Committee on 2021 Annual Budget.
You also represented that in the 23 March 2021 hearing, the Special Committee confirmed that all documents were properly submitted by the different departments and offices so that you find the consequent submission by said Committee of its report recommending for the disapproval of the 2021 Executive Budget and thereafter, the actual disapproval by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan as a surprise.
Per the copy of the Committee Report submitted on 31 March 2021, their recommendation for the disapproval of the 2021 Executive Budget was anchored on the following grounds:
1. Inconsistency between the Budget Message of the Local Chief Executive (LCE) and the substantial provisions of the proposed executive budget;
2. Existence of Lumpsum Appropriations in violation of relevant budget standards; and
3. Inconsistency between the amount provided in the Annual Investment Plan and the Proposed Executive Budget making the latter bloated and dissimilar with the Planning Document.
