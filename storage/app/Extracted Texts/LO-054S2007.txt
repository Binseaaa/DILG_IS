Dear Hon. Jurillia:

undertakings of LGUs that are subject to public hearings as a condition

Relative to the above, please be informed that under the Local
Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160), prior public hearings are required where:
(1) local government site, offices and facilities are to be transferred (par. b and
par. c, Section 11, RA 7160); (2) reclassification of agricultural lands (Sec. 20,
ibid); (3) contribution of funds, real estate, equipment, and other kinds of
property and appointment or assignment of personnel in support of
undertakings commonly beneficial to local government units which have
grouped themseives, consolidated or coordinated their efforts, services and
resources (Sec. 33, ibid); (4) levy of taxes, fees or charges on any base or subject
not otherwise specifically enumerated in the Local Government Code as taxed
under the NIRC, as amended, or other applicable laws (Sec. 186, ibid); and (5)
enactment of local tax ordinances and revenue measures (Sec. 187, ibid).

We hope we have guided you accordingly.

Very truly yours,
