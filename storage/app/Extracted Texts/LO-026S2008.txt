Dear Atty. Marasigan:

This pertains to your earlier letter requesting for legal opinion on whether or not Atty. Angel Chona I. Valero, a duly elected Barangay Kagawa of Poblacion, that city, can be appointed as City Legal Officer of Manila.

In reply thereto, may we invite your attention to Section 94 (a) of the Local Government Code, which provides:

"SEC. 94. Appointment of Elective and Appointive Local Officials; Candidates Who Lost in an Election.- (a) No elective or appointive local official shall be eligible for appointment or designation in any capacity to any public office or position during his tenure.

Unless otherwise allowed by law or by the primary functions of his position, no elective or appointive local official shall hold any other office or employment in the government or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporation or their subsidiaries."

With the foregoing provision, it is clear that an elective local official is not eligible to be appointed or designated in any capacity to any public office or position in the government during his tenure.

We hope to have clarified you on the matter.

Very truly yours,

AUSTERE A. PANADERO
Undersecretary
