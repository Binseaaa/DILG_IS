ATTY. P. DARIO GUEVARRA
City Legal Officer
Tanauan City

Dear Atty. Guevarra:

This refers to your request for legal opinion regarding Section 345 of the
Local Government Code (RA 7160) which provides for the signatories to checks,

i.e., treasurer and administrator, considering the fact that Tanauan City has no
local administrator yet.

In reply to your query, please be informed that Section 345 of RA 7160
clearly mandates that checks in settlement of obligations shall be drawn by the
local treasurer and countersigned by the local administrator. However, the
permanent absence of the local administrator, not having been appointed yet,
should not be a hindrance for the local government unit to transact its usual

business, as it is a well-entrenched rule that the law does not require the
impossible.

Such being the case, we are of the opinion that the City Mayor can directly
perform the functions of the local administrator based on her statutory function to
“exercise general supervision and control over all programs,

projects, services and activities of the city government” (Sec. 445 [b]
[1], RA 7160).

Ergo, the City Mayor has enough authority to countersign the checks drawn
by the City Treasurer until such time that the City Administrator is appointed.

Parenthetically, please be reminded that the appointment of an
Administrator is mandatory for city governments (Sec. 480 [a] [3], RA 71 60), thus
we enjoin your city to comply with the same.

We hope we have enlightened you accordingly.

Very truly yours,

AL

NCELITO T. ANDANAR
