                            6975, otherwise known as the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Act of 1990,
                            operationalized and initiated the call for a tangible reform in the countryâ€™s public safety
                            services particularly for the uniformed bureaus under DILG.

                            The same Act factually complied with the constitutional mandate for a unified single national
                            police force, which is civilian in character under the administration of the National Police
                            Commission (NAPOLCOM). Likewise, the same law upgraded the fire and jail services as new and
                            separate bureaus under the DILG stewardship.</p>

                            Criminal Justice System, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) was created to
                            address growing concern of jail management and penology problem. Primarily, its clients are
                            detainees accused before a court who are temporarily confined in such jails while undergoing
                            investigation, waiting final judgement and those who are serving sentence promulgated by the
                            court 3 years and below. As provided for under R.A. No. 6975, the Jail Bureau is mandated to
                            take operational and administrative control over all city, district and municipal jails.</p>

                            We acknowledge that law enforcers are vulnerable to some opportunities for corruption, but the
                            PNP leadership has continued to strive to block these opportunities for corruption to take
